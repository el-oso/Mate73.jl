    MatteSeven

Read and write MATLAB `.mat` files of version 7.3. This package uses only Julia code. It does
not use the HDF5 C library. It also works inside a small compiled program.

You tell `matread` which type you expect. It does not guess. The type of a variable comes from
the file, and a function that could return any type would not build into a small program.

```julia
f = matopen("data.mat")
keys(f)                              # the names of the variables
matsize(f, "A")                      # the size, as MATLAB gives it
A = matread(f, "A", Matrix{Float64}) # checked against the file
```
