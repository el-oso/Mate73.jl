**This package reads and writes MATLAB `.mat` files of version 7.3. It uses only Julia code.
It does not use the HDF5 C library.**

MATLAB writes version 7.3 files when you use `save -v7.3`.

**Needs Julia 1.12 or newer.** That is the first release with the `juliac` tool, which is what
the small-program support is for.

## Example

```julia
using MATTE73

d = matread("results.mat")             # every variable, in a Dict
d["A"]

matwrite("out.mat", "A" => d["A"], "label" => "hello")
```

One variable at a time:

```julia
f = matopen("results.mat")
keys(f)                                # the names of the variables
matsize(f, "A")                        # [128, 128]
A = matread(f, "A")                    # a Matrix{Float64}
```

## Two ways to read

**Use the short way. Give the type only if you build a small compiled program.**

| | short way | with the type |
|---|---|---|
| whole file | `matread(path)` | — |
| one variable | `matread(f, "A")` | `matread(f, "A", Matrix{Float64})` |
| one variable, no handle | — | `matread(path, "A", Matrix{Float64})` |
| works in a small program | no | yes |

Give a path instead of an open file when you want one variable and nothing else. Open the
file first when you want several, so it is read once rather than once for each variable.

The short way works out the type from the file, as MAT.jl does. It is the one to use in
ordinary Julia code.

The long way is for a tool named `juliac`. That tool builds a small program from Julia code.
Its option `--trim=safe` rejects any function that can return more than one type. So the
caller states the type instead.

A program that never calls the short way does not carry it. The build removes it.

## Reading several variables at once

**`@matload` gives you the short way and the fixed return type at the same time.**

You list the variables once. The macro writes one normal typed read for each line, with the
type written out. So it works inside a small compiled program.

```julia
v = @matload "results.mat" begin
    A::Matrix{Float64}          # an array
    n::Int64                    # a single number
    label::String               # one row of text
    gain = "cfg/gain"::Float64  # a field of a struct, under the name you choose
end

v.A
v.n
v.gain
```

You get a named tuple. Its type is known before the program runs.

The first item is a path or an open file. A path is opened once for the whole block. Give an
open file when you already have one:

```julia
f = matopen("results.mat")
v = @matload f A::Matrix{Float64}
```

A plain number type means a MATLAB scalar, which is a 1x1 array in the file. You get the
value. If the variable holds more than one value, this stops with an error.

The two line forms:

| you write | it reads |
|---|---|
| `name::Type` | the variable called `name` |
| `name = "a/path"::Type` | that path, under the name `name` |

The first item is a path, an open file, or a file and a mark. With `f, ref` every path in the
block starts at `ref`.

## What the check does

When you give the type, the package does 3 checks against the file:

1. the kind of number, such as a whole number or a decimal number
2. the width in bytes
3. the sign, for whole numbers

If a check fails, the package stops with an error. It does not read the bytes as the wrong
type.

Use `matclass` first if you do not know what is in the file. It gives a name for the type. It
gives `MAT_UNSUPPORTED` for a type this package does not read. It does not stop with an error.

## Order of the dimensions

**You get the same array that MATLAB shows. Nothing is turned around.**

MATLAB and Julia both put the first dimension down the columns. The file keeps the dimensions
in the opposite order. The two effects cancel.

## What this package reads

| MATLAB type | Julia type |
|---|---|
| `double`, `single` | `Array{Float64,N}`, `Array{Float32,N}` |
| `int8` to `int64`, `uint8` to `uint64` | `Array{T,N}` |
| `logical` | `Array{Bool,N}` |
| complex numbers | `Array{Complex{T},N}` |
| `char`, one row | `String` |
| `char`, any shape | `Array{Char,N}` |
| empty arrays | the shape stays, such as `0x3` |
| `cell` | `Array{MatRef,N}`, one mark for each item |
| `struct` | fields by path; `matkeys` gives the names |
| struct arrays | each field is an `Array{MatRef,N}` |
| objects of a class you wrote | properties by path |
| `datetime` | `Array{DateTime,N}` |
| `string`, `categorical` | `Array{String,N}` |
| `table` | a `NamedTuple` of columns |
| function handles | the values MATLAB stored, by path |
| objects of a class written before 2008 | properties by path |

## Boxes with mixed contents

**A cell array gives you marks, not values. You follow one mark at a time.**

Think of a cloakroom. You get a numbered ticket, not the coat. You hand back one ticket and
get one coat.

The items in a cell array can have different types. A function that returns all of them at
once would have no single type. So you get one mark for each item. The mark type is `MatRef`.

```julia
cells = matread(f, "c", Matrix{MatRef})
matclass(f, cells[1])                     # look before you choose a type
matread(f, cells[1], Matrix{Float64})     # follow the mark

matkeys(f, "s")                           # the field names of a struct
matread(f, "s/a", Matrix{Float64})        # one field, by path
```

A cell inside a cell gives you more marks. The steps stay the same.

**A path can also start at a mark.** This is how you read a field of a struct held in a cell:

```julia
runs = matread(f, "runs", Matrix{MatRef})
one = runs[1, 1]

matread(f, one, "count", Float64)                # one number
matread(f, one, "inner/values", Matrix{Float64}) # a field of a field
matref(f, one, "inner")                          # step down without reading

v = @matload f, one begin                        # or read several at once
    count = "count"::Float64
    values = "inner/values"::Matrix{Float64}
end
```

## Objects of a class

**An object holds no data. It holds numbers that point into a table.**

Think of a library catalogue card. The card is not the book. The card tells you the shelf.

MATLAB keeps the table in a hidden part of the file. This package follows the numbers for you.
An object then behaves like a struct.

```julia
matobjectclass(f, "obj")                  # "TestClasses.BasicClass"
matkeys(f, "obj")                         # the property names
matread(f, "obj/a", Matrix{Float64})      # one property, by path
```

Properties added later with `addprop` are in the list too. An object held by another object
is found as well.

A `datetime`, a `string`, a `categorical` and a `table` are objects too, and the package knows
the rule for each.

A saved function handle holds no code. MATLAB stores a named handle such as `@sin` as the
name `sin`, and an anonymous one such as `@(x) x` as the text of the expression plus the
values it captured. It reads as a set of named values, like a struct. You can see what a file
referred to. You cannot call it from Julia.

## Tables

**A table reads as a named tuple of columns.**

A named tuple of vectors is already a column table, so anything that reads the Tables.jl
interface takes the result as it is. This package needs no dependency for that.

```julia
t = matread(f, "flights")     # every column, with the types taken from the file
t.Customer

using DataFrames
DataFrame(t)
```

For a small compiled program you state the columns and their types. Each type is the type of
a whole column, so it is a `Vector`:

```julia
t = matread(f, "flights", NamedTuple{
    (:FlightNum, :Customer),
    Tuple{Vector{Float64}, Vector{String}},
})
```

You may ask for some of the columns only, in any order.

## Writing

```julia
matwrite("out.mat", "A" => A, "flags" => flags, "label" => "hello")
```

**A named tuple becomes a struct. A tuple becomes a cell array. Both nest.**

```julia
matwrite(
    "run.mat",
    "cfg"  => (gain = 2.5, mode = "fast", limits = (1.0, 10.0)),
    "runs" => ([1.0 2.0], "second", (name = "third", ok = true)),
)
```

| you give | MATLAB sees |
|---|---|
| an `Array` of numbers or `Bool` | an array of the matching type |
| one number or `Bool` | a 1x1 array |
| a `String` | text |
| a `NamedTuple` | a struct, one field per name |
| a `Tuple` | a cell array of one row |

Every type is settled while your program is compiled, so writing works inside a small compiled
program, as reading does.

A result written from a named tuple reads back into one:

```julia
matwrite("out.mat", "gain" => 2.5, "label" => "run 3")

v = @matload "out.mat" begin
    gain::Float64
    label::String
end
```

The package does not compress. Files are therefore larger than the files MATLAB writes.

## What this package does not do

Two limits are quiet. The package gives an answer, but not the answer you asked for. These
come first, because a quiet limit is easy to miss.

- **The order of struct fields.** `matkeys` gives the names in file order. MATLAB may use a
  different order. The names are correct. The values are correct. Only the order can differ.
- **Arrays of objects.** One variable can point to many objects. This package uses the first
  one. `matobjectclass`, `matkeys` and a property path all describe that first object.

The other limits stop with an error, or report `MAT_UNSUPPORTED`.

- **Sparse arrays.**
- **Objects of the MATLAB types** `duration` and `calendarDuration`. The package reads their
  class and their properties. It cannot build the value that MATLAB shows. That step needs a
  rule for each type, and only `datetime`, `string`, `categorical` and `table` have one so
  far.
- **Calling a function handle.** The file holds a name, or the text of an expression. Turning
  either one into something you can call is a job for a different tool.
- **An element of a `categorical` with no choice.** MATLAB shows it as `<undefined>`. There
  is no text for it, so this stops with an error.
- **The row names of a table.** Only the columns are read.
- **The default value of a property.** A class can give a property a value in its own
  definition. The package does not read those, so an object that never set the property
  lists no property at all.
- **Properties kept in the table.** Most properties point to a value. Some small ones sit in
  the table itself. The package cannot read those.
- **Text above code point 65535.** MATLAB keeps text as 16-bit units. `Array{Char,N}` gives
  you those units. One rare character then arrives as 2 units. The `String` method joins them
  correctly.
- **Compression when writing.**
- **Writing a cell array with no items.** An empty tuple stops with an error.
- **Writing complex numbers, sparse arrays, `datetime`, `string` or objects.** These read, but
  nothing writes them yet.

`keys(f)` also lists 2 names that MATLAB uses for itself: `#refs#` and `#subsystem#`. Skip
them if you only want your own variables.

The package does not read some file layouts: fractal heap groups, superblock versions 1 and 3,
and filters other than deflate and shuffle. MATLAB does not write these. Other tools can.

## Tests

**Every value is compared against a second, independent reader.**

The tests use MAT.jl. That package reads through the HDF5 C library. It shares no code with
this one. The test files come from MATLAB itself.

Files that this package writes are read back through the same C library. That library checks
the internal totals in the file. A bad file fails there. A file cannot pass by being wrong in
the same way twice.

## The small-program check

**A test proves that this package works inside a small compiled program.**

Two checks run, and they cover different things.

1. `trim/trimcheck.jl` runs the compiler check on every entry point. It finds the same
   problems the real build finds.
2. `juliac/build.jl` builds a real program and runs it. This step also links the program and
   starts it. The first check does neither.

Run them yourself:

```
julia --project=. juliac/build.jl
```

The build fails unless the program prints the same answer as normal Julia code.
